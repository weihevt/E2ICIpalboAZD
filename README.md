## WEE1 inhibition delays resistance in ER+ MCF7 breast cancer
[08/07/2025] This repository contains the MATLAB (R2023a) code, which does not use external packages, for the paper titled
"**WEE1 inhibition delays resistance to CDK4/6 inhibitor and antiestrogen treatment in estrogen receptor-positive MCF7 breast cancer cells: experiments and mathematical modeling**"

The _code_ folder contains the functions used in the work. 
### Functions
***(1).E2ICIpalboAZD_main()***\
Main function to run the simulation. Generates plots for Figures 5A-F, 6E-F, Supplementary Figures 1A-D, and 2 using the single optimized parameter. These are primary simulation results, compared directly with experimental data.\
***(2).E2ICIpalboAZD_test()***\
This function estimates model parameters based on experimental data.
